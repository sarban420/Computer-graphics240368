algorithm
<br>
Start
Declare x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , dx, step as integer variable and x, y, xinc, yinc as floating point.
Enter value of x1 , y1 , x2 , y2
Calculate dx = x2 – x1
Calculate dy = y2 – y1
If |dx| > |dy| Then, step = |dx| Else, step = |dy|
xinc = dx /step yinc = dy / step assign x = x1 assign y = y1
Set pixel (x1, y1 )

conclusion: learned about dda line drawing algorithm in this lab
