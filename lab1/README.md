algorithm
<br>
  1. Start
  2. Declare x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , dx, step as integer variable and x, y, xinc, yinc as floating point.
  3. Enter value of x1 , y1 , x2 , y2
  4. Calculate dx = x2 – x1
  5. Calculate dy = y2 – y1
  6. If |dx| > |dy| Then, step = |dx| Else, step = |dy|
  7.xinc = dx /step yinc = dy / step assign x = x1 assign y = y1
  8.Set pixel (x1, y1 )

  conclusion: learned about DDA line drawing algorithm in this lab.
